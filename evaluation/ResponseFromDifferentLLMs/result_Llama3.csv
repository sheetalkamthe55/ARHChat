What cohesion and coupling levels are desirable for the new architecture?,"Based on the provided context, it seems that the authors of the paper are aiming to optimize the microservices-based application by minimizing coupling and maximizing cohesion

According to the equations presented in the paper:

* Coupling (RCA) = âˆ‘ âˆ€MS câˆˆRCA Î´(MS c)
* Cohesion (RCA) = âˆ‘ âˆ€MS câˆˆRCA C(MS c)

The authors aim to minimize the coupling between microservices and maximize the cohesion within each microservice

In general, desirable levels of cohesion and coupling for a microservices-based architecture are:

* High cohesion: Each microservice should have a clear and well-defined responsibility, with a high degree of internal consistency and minimal dependencies on other services
* Low coupling: Microservices should be loosely coupled, meaning that changes to one service should not affect the others in significant ways

In terms of specific numbers, it's difficult to provide exact thresholds for cohesion and coupling, as they depend on the specific requirements and constraints of the application However, here are some general guidelines:

* Cohesion: A good rule of thumb is to aim for a cohesion score of at least 07-08, indicating that most methods within a microservice are strongly related
* Coupling: Aim for a coupling score of less than 03-04, indicating that the interactions between microservices are minimal and well-contained

Keep in mind that these are general guidelines, and the optimal levels of cohesion and coupling may vary depending on the specific requirements and constraints of your application","Aim for high cohesion within each microservice by ensuring that its components and functionalities are closely related and focused on a specific business domain or capability. Strive for loose coupling between microservices to minimize dependencies and enable changes in one service without impacting others, promoting flexibility and autonomy.",3
How do we manage complexity and granularity in the microservices?,"According to the provided context, managing complexity and granularity in microservices is a crucial aspect The authors propose a model called Microservices Backlog (MB) that helps determine and evaluate the granularity of microservices at design time

The MB model considers several metrics, including:

1 Coupling: measures the degree of dependence between microservices
2 Cohesion: measures the degree to which user stories are related within a microservice
3 Number of user stories associated with a microservice (WsicT)
4 Cognitive complexity points (CxT): measures the complexity of the user stories
5 Semantic similarity (SsT): measures the similarity between user stories and microservices

The authors also propose a genetic algorithm to optimize the granularity of microservices based on these metrics

To manage complexity, the MB model aims to:

1 Reduce coupling: by minimizing the dependencies between microservices
2 Increase cohesion: by grouping related user stories within a microservice
3 Minimize cognitive complexity: by reducing the number of user stories associated with each microservice

By using the MB model and genetic algorithm, developers can optimize the granularity of their microservices to achieve better modularity, scalability, maintainability, and traceability

Some key takeaways from the context are:

* Granularity adaptation entails merging or decomposing microservices to move to a finer or coarser-grained granularity level
* The problem in finding service granularity is to identify a correct boundary (size) for each service in the system
* Microservices should have a specific purpose, and services/operations/stories that refer to the same purpose should be grouped in the same microservice

Overall, the MB model provides a framework for managing complexity and granularity in microservices by optimizing their design and structure","Microservices Decomposition: Break down complex functionalities into smaller, manageable microservices with well-defined boundaries and responsibilities to reduce complexity. Service Orchestration: Use service orchestration patterns like choreography or workflow engines to manage interactions and dependencies between microservices effectively.

7 **Rate Limiting**: Apply rate limiting using tools like NGINX, Apache, or AWS API Gateway to restrict the number of requests that can be made to a service within a certain time frame This helps prevent overload and interference between services
8 **Service Segregation**: Physically segregate services by running them on separate machines, containers, or virtual machines This ensures that each service has its own isolated environment and doesn't interfere with other services
9 **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement monitoring and logging tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK Stack to track service performance and detect potential issues before they become critical
10 **Service Abstraction**: Use abstraction layers like interfaces or APIs to decouple services from each other This allows services to evolve independently without affecting other services

10 **Continuously monitor and refactor**: Continuously monitor your microservice-based system for issues caused by technology heterogeneity and refactor the system as needed to ensure that it remains scalable, maintainable, and efficient

By following these strategies, you can effectively handle technology heterogeneity across microservices and build a more resilient and scalable system","Introduce an API gateway to abstract technology differences and provide a unified interface for clients, enabling seamless communication with heterogeneous microservices. Or implement a service mesh to manage communication, security, and observability across microservices, regardless of the underlying technologies. We can also define standardized communication protocols and interfaces to facilitate interoperability and integration between diverse technologies used in microservices .",3
What guidelines or workflows can we establish to guide the migration process? How can we document these effectively?,"Based on the provided context, it seems that the authors of the paper are proposing a pattern-based approach for cloud architecture migration They suggest using a set of predefined patterns as building blocks to create a migration plan

How should we represent the list of services that will replace the monolith? Is there a preferred format or structure?,"Representing the list of services that will replace the monolith is crucial for effective communication, planning, and implementation Here are some common formats and structures to consider:

1 **Service Catalog**: Create a table or spreadsheet with columns for:
	* Service Name
	* Description
	* Responsibilities (eg, what functionality each service will handle)
	* Dependencies (if any)
	* Technology Stack (eg, programming languages, frameworks)
2 **Service Map**: Visualize the services as a diagram, using tools like Lucidchart, Drawio, or Graphviz This can help illustrate relationships between services and identify potential bottlenecks

	* Status (eg, planned, in development, deployed)

When choosing a format or structure, consider the following factors:

1 **Team size and expertise**: If your team is small, a simple table or spreadsheet might be sufficient For larger teams, a more comprehensive document or diagram may be necessary
2 **Complexity of services**: If you have many services with complex relationships, a visual representation (eg, service map) can help clarify the architecture
3 **Communication needs**: Consider who will need to access and understand the list of services A simple table or document might be sufficient for internal stakeholders, while a more detailed diagram may be necessary for external partners or investors
4 **Evolutionary requirements**: Choose a format that allows for easy updates and changes as your architecture evolves

Ultimately, the chosen format should facilitate effective communication, planning, and implementation of your microservices-based system","Maintain a service registry or catalog listing all microservices, their endpoints, versions, and dependencies to provide a centralized view of the system. Define API gateway configurations mapping incoming requests to corresponding microservices to streamline communication and routing.",3
Can we extract relevant portions of the monolithâ€™s source code to aid in microservice creation?,"Yes, extracting relevant portions of the monolith's source code can be a crucial step in creating microservices The context mentions that several approaches have been proposed for identifying microservices from monolithic applications by partitioning the OO implementation into clusters of classes

Some of these approaches involve analyzing the source code to identify cohesive units or groups of classes that can be transformed into microservices For instance, Levcovitz et al  proposed a data-based technology to extract microservices from a monolithic architecture by mapping database tables to subsystems and finding paths on the dependency graph to obtain candidate microservices

Similarly, Mazlami et al  proposed a microservice extraction model using a code repository as input The model first converts individual units in the code repository into a graph representation and then uses a clustering algorithm on the graph to obtain microservice candidates

In another approach, Baresi et al  proposed a method to identify microservices using interface analysis based on the OpenAPI specification to identify cohesive operation groups with similar semantics as candidate microservices

These approaches demonstrate that analyzing source code can be an effective way to extract relevant portions of the monolith's source code and aid in creating microservices

1 Identify cohesive units or groups of classes within the monolith's source code
2 Analyze the dependencies between these classes to determine which ones can be grouped together as a microservice
3 Use clustering algorithms or other techniques to identify patterns and relationships in the source code that can help guide the creation of microservices

By extracting relevant portions of the monolith's source code, you can gain insights into the system's architecture and functionality, which can inform your decisions about how to partition the system into microservices

What recommendations exist for splitting the monolith into smaller services? Are there best practices or patterns?,"Yes, there are several recommendations, best practices, and patterns for splitting a monolith into smaller services Here are some of them:

1 **Start with a clear understanding of the business capabilities**: Identify the core business capabilities that need to be separated from each other This will help you determine the boundaries between services
2 **Use Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Apply DDD principles to identify bounded contexts, which are self-contained domains that can be treated as separate services
3 **Identify functional silos**: Look for areas of the monolith where different teams or departments work independently, and consider separating these into separate services
4 **Use a service-oriented architecture (SOA)**: Design your services to be loosely coupled, with clear interfaces and APIs that define how they interact with each other
5 **Consider the 3-tier architecture**: Divide your application into three tiers:
	* Presentation tier (UI): handles user input and output
	* Application tier (business logic): contains the business logic and rules
	* Data tier (database): stores and retrieves data
6 **Use a microkernel architecture**: Design your services to be modular, with a central ""microkernel"" that coordinates interactions between services
7 **Start small and iterate**: Don't try to split the monolith into too many services at once Start with a small number of services and gradually add more as needed
8 **Use a service registry**: Implement a service registry (eg, Eureka, Consul) to manage the discovery and registration of services
9 **Implement circuit breakers and fallbacks**: Use circuit breakers and fallbacks to handle failures and errors between services
10 **Monitor and analyze performance**: Monitor the performance of each service and analyze any issues that arise

Some popular patterns for splitting a monolith into smaller services include:

1 **Strangler pattern**: Gradually replace parts of the monolith with new services, while still maintaining the existing functionality
2 **Feature toggle pattern**: Implement feature toggles to enable or disable specific features or services without affecting the rest of the application
3 **Service decomposition pattern**: Decompose a large service into smaller, more manageable services that can be developed and maintained independently

Remember that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to splitting a monolith into smaller services The best approach will depend on your specific use case, technology stack, and organizational constraints","Apply Domain-Driven Design(DDD) principles to identify bounded contexts and define service boundaries based on business domains. Also, gradually replace functionalities of the monolith with microservices over time, following the strangler pattern to minimize disruptions .",3
How can we visualize the microservices and their interactions?,"Visualizing microservices and their interactions is crucial for understanding the architecture, identifying potential issues, and optimizing system performance Here are some ways to visualize microservices:

1 **Microservice diagrams**: Create a diagram that shows each microservice as a box or node, with arrows representing the interactions between them You can use tools like Graphviz, PlantUML, or drawio to create these diagrams
2 **Service mesh visualization**: Use service mesh tools like Istio, Linkerd, or Consul to visualize the communication patterns between microservices These tools provide a graphical representation of the services, their dependencies, and the traffic flowing between them
3 **Flowcharts**: Create flowcharts that illustrate the sequence of events and interactions between microservices This can help identify potential bottlenecks and areas for optimization
4 **State diagrams**: Use state diagrams to visualize the different states a microservice can be in (eg, active, idle, failed) and how it transitions between them
5 **Graph databases**: Store microservice relationships as graph data structures and use visualization tools like Gephi or Cytoscape to create interactive graphs that show the interactions between services
6 **Monitoring dashboards**: Use monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or New Relic to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) for each microservice, such as request latency, error rates, and throughput
7 **Service catalog visualization**: Create a service catalog that lists all the available microservices, their descriptions, and their dependencies This can help developers quickly find and understand the services they need to interact with

Utilize runtime monitoring tools like Prometheus or Zipkin to visualize real-time interactions and performance metrics between microservices.,3
The monolith exposes APIs or interfaces. How can we break them down into microservices?,"Breaking down a monolithic system's APIs or interfaces into microservices requires careful planning and consideration of several factors Here are some steps to help you achieve this:

1 **Identify the business capabilities**: Start by identifying the high-level business capabilities that your monolith provides These can be functions, features, or processes that deliver value to your customers
2 **Analyze the APIs and interfaces**: Study the existing APIs and interfaces exposed by your monolith Identify which ones are tightly coupled, which ones are used frequently, and which ones are critical to the business capabilities
3 **Group similar APIs together**: Group similar APIs or interfaces that serve a common purpose or deliver a specific business capability This will help you identify potential microservices
4 **Consider the data ownership**: Identify the data entities that each API or interface operates on Data ownership is crucial in microservices architecture, as it determines which service is responsible for managing and updating the data
5 **Evaluate the coupling between APIs**: Assess the coupling between APIs and interfaces If they are tightly coupled, consider breaking them down into separate services to improve maintainability and scalability
6 **Identify the boundaries**: Determine the natural boundaries between microservices These can be based on business capabilities, data ownership, or functional responsibilities
7 **Design the microservices**: Based on your analysis, design each microservice with a clear set of responsibilities, APIs, and interfaces Ensure that each service is self-contained and has its own database or data storage mechanism
8 **Implement the microservices**: Implement each microservice using a suitable programming language, framework, and architecture Consider using containerization (eg, Docker) and orchestration tools (eg, Kubernetes) to manage the services
9 **Integrate the microservices**: Integrate the microservices using APIs or interfaces that follow the principles of loose coupling and high cohesion

Some popular techniques for breaking down monolithic systems into microservices include:

2 **Event Storming**: Visualize the events and processes in your system to identify potential microservices
3 **Microkernel Architecture**: Start with a small core service that provides basic functionality, then add additional services around it

Remember that breaking down a monolithic system into microservices is a complex process that requires careful planning, analysis, and testing It's essential to prioritize the business capabilities and data ownership when designing your microservices architecture","Analyze the monolith's APIs to identify distinct functionalities and endpoints that can be encapsulated as microservices. Determine service boundaries based on business domains or functionalities to ensure clear separation and encapsulation of microservices. Utilize an API gateway to route requests to the appropriate microservices based on defined paths or patterns, enabling seamless communication. Break down complex APIs into smaller, specialized microservices that handle specific tasks or operations, promoting modularity and scalability.",3
How to deal with database schema or data storage mechanisms used by the monolith?,"When migrating from a monolithic architecture to microservices, dealing with the database schema or data storage mechanisms used by the monolith is a crucial step Here are some strategies to consider:

1 **Extract and transform**: Extract the relevant data from the monolith's database and transform it into a format suitable for the new microservice-based architecture
2 **Decompose the database**: Decompose the monolithic database into smaller, independent databases or data stores that can be managed by individual microservices
3 **Use polyglot persistence**: Implement polyglot persistence, which allows multiple data storage technologies to coexist and interact with each other seamlessly
4 **Choose a suitable data storage technology**: Select a data storage technology that is well-suited for the specific needs of each microservice, such as relational databases (eg, MySQL), NoSQL databases (eg, MongoDB), or graph databases (eg, Neo4j)
5 **Use APIs and messaging queues**: Use APIs and messaging queues to enable communication between microservices and decouple them from the monolith's database
6 **Migrate data incrementally**: Migrate data incrementally, starting with a small subset of data and gradually migrating more data as needed
7 **Monitor and optimize**: Monitor the performance and scalability of the new data storage mechanisms and optimize them as needed to ensure optimal performance

Some specific techniques for dealing with database schema or data storage mechanisms used by the monolith include:

1 **Database refactoring**: Refactor the monolithic database schema to make it more modular, scalable, and maintainable
2 **Data migration scripts**: Write data migration scripts to transform data from the monolith's database into a format suitable for the new microservice-based architecture
3 **Data synchronization**: Implement data synchronization mechanisms to ensure that data is consistent across multiple databases or data stores
4 **Database sharding**: Shard the monolithic database into smaller, independent databases or data stores to improve scalability and performance

By using these strategies and techniques, you can effectively deal with the database schema or data storage mechanisms used by the monolith and successfully migrate your application to a microservices-based architecture","Analyze the monolith's database schema to understand data relationships and dependencies that need to be preserved or refactored. Develop a migration plan to transition data from the monolith's database to microservices' data stores, ensuring data consistency and integrity. Create data access layers within microservices to interact with the database, encapsulating data operations and ensuring separation of concerns. Consider data replication techniques or synchronization mechanisms to maintain data consistency between the monolith and microservices during the transition .",3
"How is the monolithâ€™s source code refactored into smaller, cohesive services?","According to the provided context, there are several approaches proposed for decomposing a monolithic application into microservices Here's an overview of some of these methods:

1 **Verb-based and noun-based word analysis**: Vresk et al suggested that a combination of verb-based and noun-based word analysis in source code could be a criterion for decomposing an application
2 **Dataflow model decomposition**: Li et al proposed a technique based on the dataflow model of the application, transforming the dataflow diagram into a modified dataflow, and then splitting it into microservices candidates
3 **Semantic similarity analysis**: Mazlami et al suggested analyzing source code semantic similarity to extract microservices from monoliths
4 **Contributor's commit history analysis**: Mazlami et al also proposed a methodology based on contributors' commits histories, splitting the monolith application into microservices candidates
5 **OpenAPI specification matching**: Baresi et al suggested matching terms in API specifications against a reference vocabulary to identify microservices

In addition to these approaches, there are other methods that rely on software architects' experience or software artifacts besides source codes, such as:

1 **Software architect's intuition and experience**: Monolithic architecture is often carried out by relying on the software architect's intuition and experience
2 **Domain-driven design (DDD)**: DDD focuses on domain model development, which can be used to create bounded contexts that separate different business concepts/business domains in software

In terms of refactoring monoliths into microservices, some approaches involve:

1 **Clustering**: Clustering algorithms are applied to aggregate domain entities that are shared by the same controllers, reducing the decomposition impact on the monolith's business functionality
2 **Call graph analysis**: Call graphs are obtained for controllers, which are associated with the monolith functionalities Domain entities accessed by each controller are identified, and a clustering algorithm is applied to reduce the decomposition impact

These approaches aim to transform monolithic applications into microservices-oriented architecture (MSA) by analyzing source code, identifying domain entities, and applying clustering algorithms to group related components together

Please note that these methods might have limitations and may not be applicable to all types of monoliths or microservices The choice of approach depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the application being refactored","Identify cohesive modules within the monolith that can be extracted as standalone services based on business capabilities or functional boundaries.

2 **Scalability**: Do you expect your application to scale horizontally (add more instances) or vertically (increase resources)? If so, consider using a cloud-native platform like Spring Cloud or Apache Stratos
3 **Integration**: Are there other systems or services that need to be integrated with your application? If so, consider using an integration framework like Apache Camel

Ultimately, the best tool for refactoring your Java application into microservices will depend on your specific requirements and constraints I recommend exploring each of these options in more detail to determine which one is the best fit for your project",A tool called MicroRefact to automatically evolve a Java monolithic application into a microservice-based one.,3
What is Docker?,"Docker is a containerization platform that allows developers to package, ship, and run applications in containers Containers are lightweight and portable, allowing for easy deployment and management of applications across different environments

Here's a brief overview:

**Key Features:**

1 **Containerization**: Docker creates isolated environments (containers) for each application, ensuring that each app runs independently without interfering with others
2 **Portability**: Containers can run on any platform that supports Docker, including Windows, macOS, and Linux
3 **Lightweight**: Containers are much lighter than virtual machines, making them faster to spin up and down
4 **Isolation**: Each container has its own isolated environment, ensuring that applications don't conflict with each other

**How it works:**

1 **Image creation**: Developers create a Docker image by packaging their application code, dependencies, and configuration files into a single file
2 **Container creation**: The Docker engine creates a new container from the image, running the application inside it
3 **Runtime environment**: The container runs in its own isolated environment, with access to the host machine's resources (eg, CPU, memory, network)

**Benefits:**

1 **Faster deployment**: Containers can be spun up and down quickly, making it easier to deploy applications
2 **Improved resource utilization**: Containers share the same kernel as the host machine, reducing overhead and improving resource efficiency
3 **Easier management**: Docker provides a simple way to manage containers, including scaling, updating, and monitoring

**Common use cases:**

1 **Web development**: Developers can create and deploy web applications using Docker, ensuring consistent environments across different machines
2 **DevOps**: Docker helps streamline the development-to-production process by providing a consistent environment for testing and deployment
3 **Cloud computing**: Containers are well-suited for cloud-based deployments, allowing for easy scaling and management of applications

That's a brief overview of Docker! Do you have any specific questions or use cases in mind?","Docker is an open source platform that enables developers to build, deploy, run, update and manage containerized applications.",3
What is an API Gateway?,"An API Gateway is a server that sits in front of one or more backend services and acts as the single entry point for clients to access those services It's essentially a reverse proxy that handles incoming requests, routes them to the appropriate service, and returns the response back to the client

API Gateways provide several benefits, including:

1 **Security**: They can enforce authentication, rate limiting, and other security measures to protect your backend services
2 **Traffic Management**: They can distribute traffic across multiple instances of a service, ensuring scalability and high availability
3 **Caching**: They can cache responses from your backend services to reduce the load on those services and improve performance
4 **Content Routing**: They can route requests based on content types, such as JSON or XML, to ensure that the correct response is returned
5 **Analytics**: They can collect metrics and analytics data about incoming requests, helping you understand how your API is being used

API Gateways are commonly used in microservices architectures, where multiple services need to communicate with each other They help to decouple the services from each other and provide a single entry point for clients to access those services

Some popular examples of API Gateways include:

* NGINX
* Amazon API Gateway
* Google Cloud Endpoints
* Microsoft Azure API Management
* AWS AppSync

I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any further questions",An API gateway isÂ a data-plane entry point for API calls that represent client requests to target applicationsÂ and services.,3
What is Service Discovery in microservices?,"Service discovery is a critical component of microservices architecture, which enables the communication between multiple services or components within a distributed system It allows services to find and communicate with each other dynamically, without requiring hardcoding of IP addresses, port numbers, or other infrastructure details

In traditional monolithic systems, services are tightly coupled, meaning that they are designed to work together as a single unit In contrast, microservices architecture is based on loose coupling, where services are independent and autonomous, but still need to communicate with each other to achieve the desired functionality

Service discovery solves this problem by providing a mechanism for services to:

1 **Register**: Services register themselves with a service registry or directory, providing information about their identity, location, and capabilities
2 **Discover**: Other services can then query the registry to find the necessary services, based on criteria such as service name, version, or functionality
3 **Communicate**: Once a service is discovered, it can establish communication with other services using standardized protocols (eg, REST, gRPC)

Service discovery enables several benefits in microservices architecture:

1 **Scalability**: Services can be scaled independently, without affecting the entire system
2 **Flexibility**: Services can be developed, deployed, and managed separately, allowing for faster innovation and adaptation to changing requirements
3 **Resilience**: If one service becomes unavailable, other services can continue to function by discovering alternative services

Some popular service discovery mechanisms include:

1 DNS-based service discovery (eg, Consul, etcd)
2 Distributed hash tables (DHTs) (eg, Apache ZooKeeper, Amazon DynamoDB)
3 Service registries (eg, Netflix Eureka, Google Cloud Endpoints)

In summary, service discovery is a crucial aspect of microservices architecture, enabling services to find and communicate with each other dynamically, while promoting scalability, flexibility, and resilience in distributed systems",A Service Discovery component acts as a registry in which the addresses of all instances are tracked. The instances have dynamically assigned network paths.,3
What is Circuit Breaking in microservices?,"In the context of microservices, circuit breaking is a design pattern that helps prevent cascading failures by detecting and isolating failed services or requests It's a way to handle situations where a service becomes unresponsive or takes too long to respond, causing a chain reaction of failures across multiple services

Here's how it works:

1 **Detection**: A circuit breaker monitors the communication between two services (eg, client and server) and detects when a request fails or times out
2 **Isolation**: When a failure is detected, the circuit breaker isolates the failed service by preventing further requests from being sent to it This prevents the failure from propagating to other services
3 **Reset**: After a certain period of time (eg, 5 minutes), the circuit breaker resets and allows new requests to be sent to the service

Circuit breaking helps in several ways:

1 **Prevents cascading failures**: By isolating failed services, you prevent a single failure from causing a chain reaction of failures across multiple services
2 **Improves system resilience**: Circuit breaking enables your system to recover more quickly from failures and reduces the impact on users
3 **Reduces latency**: By detecting and isolating failed services, circuit breaking can reduce the overall latency of your system

There are different types of circuit breakers, including:

1 **Simple circuit breaker**: A basic implementation that detects failures and isolates services
2 **Hystrix circuit breaker** (from Netflix): A more advanced implementation that provides additional features like timeouts, fallbacks, and bulkheading
3 **Resilience4j circuit breaker** (from Resilience4j): A Java-based library that provides a circuit breaker with features like timeout detection, isolation, and reset

In summary, circuit breaking is an essential design pattern in microservices architecture that helps prevent cascading failures, improves system resilience, and reduces latency","The Circuit Breaker pattern in microservices acts as a safeguard against service failures by monitoring interactions, setting thresholds, and temporarily halting/Stoping traffic to failing services.",3
What do you recommend? Migration of services should be in smaller steps or all at once?,"Based on the context provided, it seems that there is no clear recommendation for whether migration of services should be done in smaller steps or all at once However, some experts suggest that a gradual approach may be more effective

For example, Levcovitz et al  proposed a technique to identify service candidates for migrating to microservices based on mapping the dependencies between databases, business functions, and facades They evaluated their technique on a real case study (a 750 KLOC monolithic programmed in C) in the banking domain, and show that they identified successfully candidate subsystems

Balalaie et al  reported their experience of performing an incremental migration of a mobile back-end as a service (MBaaS) to microservices, coupling with DevOps methodologies They caution against considering microservices a silver bullet, as it can be beneficial to bring scalability to services, but it can introduce higher complexity as well

Furda et al  agree on defining the migration to microservices as a promising way to modernize monolithic architectures and enable full-scale utilization of cloud computing At the same time, they identify three major challenges in migrating monolithic architectures to microservices ones, namely: multitenancy, statefulness, and data consistency

Bucchiarone et al  report an experience from a real-world case study in the banking domain, of how scalability is positively affected by re-implementing a monolithic architecture into microservices Even if it presents a real and complex application migration, the approach proposed was not supported by an automatic migration tool but was only business-driven and outside-in

In general, experts suggest that a gradual approach may be more effective in migrating services to microservices This is because it allows for smaller steps, which can help reduce the risk of errors and make the process more manageable Additionally, a gradual approach can also help identify potential issues early on and allow for adjustments to be made before proceeding with the migration

However, there is no one-size-fits-all answer, and the best approach will depend on the specific needs and requirements of your organization It may be helpful to consult with experts in the field or conduct further research to determine the best approach for your situation","According to the paper, the authors recommend a gradual approach to migrating from a monolithic application to microservices-based architecture. They suggest breaking down the migration process into smaller steps and iteratively refactoring the code. The authors argue that this approach is more feasible and less risky than attempting a ""all at once"" migration, where all the changes are made at once. ",3
